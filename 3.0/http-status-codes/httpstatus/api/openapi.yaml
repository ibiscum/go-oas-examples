        The request has succeeded. The meaning of the success depends on the HTTP method:
        * `GET`: The resource has been fetched and is transmitted in the message body.
        * `HEAD`: The representation headers are included in the response without any message body.
        * `PUT` or `POST`: The resource describing the result of the action is transmitted in the message body.
        * `TRACE`: The message body contains the request message as received by the server.
